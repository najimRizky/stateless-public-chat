<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my first adventure in using websocket technology. The purpose of making this simple application is to get to know about websocket technology. This application can be used to chat by many users simultaneously and without using a database at all (stateless).

If you have any suggestions or criticisms, don't hesitate to let me know.
